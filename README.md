Project Title: Titanic Survial Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project utilizes logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict the likelihood of survival of passengers on 
the Titanic. The project is based on the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic when it sank.

The project uses logistic regression to build a model that predicts the probability of survival of a passenger based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket 
class, and passenger fare. The logistic regression model is trained using a portion of the Titanic dataset, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated using the 
remaining data.

The goal of the project is to create a model that accurately predicts the survival probability of a passenger on the Titanic based on the available data. This model
can then be used to analyze the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers, and to identify patterns that may have played a role in the tragedy.

The project is being developed using Python, and leverages popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to process and analyze the data. The project 
is designed to be accessible to developers and data scientists of all skill levels, and aims to provide insights into the tragic events of the Titanic disaster.
